# Task 1 - Update Git Username

## Objective

Configure your Git username.

---

## Run:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Nadeem Siddiqi"
```

---

## Explanation

This command updates your Git username globally on your local machine.

---

# Task 2 - Update Git User Email

## Objective

Configure your Git email address.

---

## Run:

```bash
git config --global user.email "nadeem.siddiqi@nit.academy"
```

---

## IMPORTANT NOTE

If you omit:

```bash
--global
```

then the updates will apply only to the current local repository and not all repositories on your PC.

---

# Task 3 - Initialize Local Repository

## Objective

Initialize a local Git repository.

---

## Run:

```bash
git init
```

---

## IMPORTANT NOTE

If your repository is already initialized, skip this step.

---

# Task 4 - Check Repository Status

## Objective

Check the status of files inside your repository.

---

## Run:

```bash
git status
```

---

## Observation

- Which files are untracked?
- Which files are modified?
- Which files are staged?

---

# Task 5 - Stage Files

## Objective

Stage files before committing them.

---

## Run:

```bash
git add .
```

---

## Explanation

This command stages all files and folders inside the current repository.

---

# Task 6 - Commit Your Work

## Objective

Save your work into Git history.

---

## Run:

```bash
git commit -m "version 1"
```

---

## Explanation

- `commit` saves a snapshot of your work
- `-m` allows you to add a commit message

---

# Task 7 - Configure SSH Keys

## Objective

Configure SSH authentication with GitHub.

---

## Instructions

Go to:

```text
git102.README.md
```

and complete the SSH Key configuration steps.

After completing SSH setup, continue to Task 8

---

# Task 8 - Check Your Branch Name

## Objective

Verify your current Git branch.

---

## Run:

```bash
git branch
```

---

## Expected Output

```bash
* master
```

> NOTE: Some newer Git versions may use `main` instead of `master`.

---

# Task 9 - Add Remote GitHub Repository

## Objective

Connect your local repository to GitHub.

---

## Run:

```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:SufiNadeem/CodeRS.git
```

---

## IMPORTANT NOTE

Replace the SSH path above with the SSH repository path from your own GitHub account.

---

## Example SSH Repository Path

```bash
git@github.com:username/repository.git
```

---

# Task 10 - Push Code to GitHub

## Objective

Push local code to the remote GitHub repository.

---

## Run:

```bash
git push -u origin master
```

---

## Explanation

| Command Part | Purpose |
|--------------|----------|
| git push | Pushes code to remote repository |
| -u | Sets upstream tracking |
| origin | Remote repository name |
| master | Branch name |

---

## IMPORTANT NOTE

If your branch name is `main`, then use:

```bash
git push -u origin main
```
